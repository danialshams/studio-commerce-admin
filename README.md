# Daira CRM — portable Next.js and PostgreSQL

Persian RTL, multi-tenant CRM, with Next.js 16, PostgreSQL and native Docker hosting. CRM is published from the **daira-crm** branch in the shared Git repository, **not** its unrelated `main` branch.

## Fictional sample data (demo)

Each organization has its own isolated database records. The **owner** can open **Settings → داده‌های نمایشی CRM → افزودن داده‌های دمو +** to populate the workspace once. New account registration has an explicitly labeled, preselected checkbox that can be unchecked to start empty. Existing records are never overwritten.

The fixture creates 14 fictional contacts, 12 sales opportunities (including won deals over the past six months), 15 follow-up tasks, 8 quotations/invoices, 6 contracts, 6 support tickets with comments, 9 logged interactions, 3 disabled example workflow rules, sample notifications, 2 **draft-only** email messages and one **draft-only** signature envelope. Every sample contact uses a reserved `@daira.example` email, a non-dialable phone placeholder, and `delivery_consent=false`. All automation rules are disabled and scheduler-based reminders skip sample tasks; nothing contacts external recipients. Sample records are clearly marked `[دمو]` in descriptions/notes or `دمو` in contact tags.

Seeding happens in one PostgreSQL transaction, under a per-organization lock, and is idempotent through `demo_seed_runs`. Repeating the action does not duplicate entries. Do not use sample sales or invoices for real financial reporting. Deleting demo content automatically is deliberately not enabled because customers might have attached their own records to the sample data.

Existing PostgreSQL databases receive `database/004_demo_data.sql` through `npm run migrate`. Fresh Docker databases initialize it automatically. The demo endpoint never exposes a production-wide seed, password or privileged bypass.

## Included features

- Organization-based signup/login, bcrypt password hashes, revocable HttpOnly sessions, login throttling, invitations (72-hour one-time URL), owner/admin/sales/support/viewer permissions.
- Contacts and leads, tagging, customer lifecycle, lead scoring field, activity logs, interactions, tasks/reminders, opportunities with pipeline and six-month metrics.
- Estimates/invoices, contracts, support tickets and replies, team permissions, CSV import/export, internal event rules, analytics and a mobile-first dashboard.
- Tenant and role-filtered notifications with 15-second UI polling. Old notifications without a typed module remain visible only to owner/admin.
- **Provider-ready customer communications:** explicit customer consent, draft messages, provider-enabled email/SMS sends, delivery history, locked queue and bounded retries.
- **Provider-ready digital signatures:** contract envelopes, external signing request, HMAC-authenticated webhook, replay protection and immutable activity record. No signed status is claimed by this integration before a verified provider event.
- Anonymous `GET /api/health` returns only `{ok: true|false}` after checking live database connectivity and required tables; it returns no credentials or customer data.

## Setup and database migrations

Node.js 22 and PostgreSQL 16+ are recommended. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure **DATABASE_URL**, **SESSION_SECRET** and **CRON_SECRET** with unique values of at least 32 characters.

```sh
npm install
npm run migrate
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run start
```

`npm run migrate` applies `database/schema.sql`, `database/003_integrations.sql` and `database/004_demo_data.sql` under a PostgreSQL advisory transaction lock. All changes are additive and repeatable. Do **not** wipe an existing database to upgrade it. Back up before production migrations.

The Vercel project runs `npm run migrate && npm run build` from `vercel.json`, so schema changes must complete before the new deployment is published. A failed migration fails the deployment and retains the last known-good production deployment. GitHub Actions tests migration, TypeScript, build and disposable PostgreSQL HTTP integration flows.

For Docker, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, configure `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_SECRET` and `CRON_SECRET`, then run `docker compose up --build -d`. Fresh database volumes initialize both SQL files. Existing Docker volumes need `docker compose exec db psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U crm -d daira_crm -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/02-integrations.sql` during a controlled upgrade.

## Optional paid providers — deliberately disabled by default

**Email**: Configure SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT (usually 465), SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD and SMTP_FROM. TLS is required. The draft/queue UI is available today; outgoing SMTP is unavailable until all settings are supplied.

**SMS**: Configure SMS_GATEWAY_URL (HTTPS only), SMS_GATEWAY_API_KEY and SMS_SENDER. The provider adapter POSTs JSON `{to,from,body,requestId}` with Bearer authorization and an Idempotency-Key header. If a provider uses a different API schema, implement its mapping inside `src/lib/providers.ts` before enabling credentials. No purchased SMS account is assumed.

**Digital signatures**: Configure SIGN_PROVIDER_URL (HTTPS), SIGN_PROVIDER_API_KEY, SIGN_WEBHOOK_SECRET (32+ random characters) and SIGN_CALLBACK_URL. The signing adapter POSTs `{requestId,signer,contract,callbackUrl}`. It requires a response `{providerRequestId,signingUrl}` where signingUrl is HTTPS. The provider must call POST `/api/webhooks/signature` with:
- `x-daira-timestamp`: 10-digit Unix time in seconds (within five minutes).
- `x-daira-signature`: `sha256=<HMAC_SHA256_HEX(secret, timestamp + "." + rawJsonBody)>`.
- JSON body: `{eventId,providerRequestId,status}` where status is signed, declined or expired.
- Event IDs must be globally unique to deduplicate callbacks.

The integration is a technical transport; legal recognition of digital signatures depends on the provider and jurisdiction. Until providers are configured, users can create drafts but no third-party messages or signing requests are dispatched. Sending requires an explicit user action and for SMS/email the recipient must have `delivery_consent=true`.

## Scheduled jobs and portability

`GET|POST /api/cron/reminders` produces idempotent reminders for tasks due today/overdue. `GET|POST /api/cron/deliveries` retries queued/failed provider messages (maximum 20 claims/run, maximum five attempts). Both require `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`. Vercel uses daily UTC cron jobs for Hobby compatibility; message queue actions also attempt immediate delivery. For more frequent retries on another host, schedule the same authenticated endpoint using system cron. No vendor-specific queue or Vercel database SDK is required.

**Migration to a private host**: Take a tested PostgreSQL backup with `pg_dump -Fc -f daira-crm.backup "$DATABASE_URL"`. On the new host, create a fresh Postgres database and run `pg_restore --no-owner --no-acl -d "$NEW_DATABASE_URL" daira-crm.backup`, then switch DATABASE_URL and deploy the same Next.js app. Rotate session/cron secrets appropriately, verify `/api/health`, move provider webhooks to the new domain and retest jobs. Use HTTPS and encrypted off-host backups. No data should be removed from the original instance until restoration is verified.

**Production checklist**: verify backup/restore, access permissions, rates, SSL, DNS, provider contracts and live customer-consent policies. Integration tests only run against disposable test databases; they must never create test customers in production.
